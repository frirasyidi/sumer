# README

This is an excercise for me to learn both TDD and Typescript.

## About the program

The program will be called Sumer. It will:

- return a number with sum of all given numbers,
- return an array that consists of sum of the numbers in the same index, and
- return an object with sum of numbers on the same keys.

When a combination of input of number, object, and arrays are given, the program shall:

- return object when one or more object is given,
- return an array if no object but one or more array is given, and
- return a number of no object or array is given.

When an object and array is added, each array's value will be given its index as the object's key.

## My pledge

During the whole session, I will:

- create this using TDD, and
- commit changes on every single red-green-refactor step.
